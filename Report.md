## 2 Data Section
#### 2.a What data is used?
    We will be completely working on Foursquare data to explore and try to locate our new hotel where more venues like church, beach, museums, memorials that are present nearby.
#### How will we be solving using this data?
        We will look for midpoint area of venues to locate our new hotel.Before that our major focus will be on all venues present in and around the core place of sharm el sheikh.
        
    Just a heads up on how many hotels are distributed now around sharm el sheikh.We will perform some EDA on hotels & restaurants present in the tourist spot.On furthur notebook we will use Foursquare data to determine other venues as well.

## 3 Methodology Section
    In this sections we will perform some data analysis and EDA to find insight from data.We will try to understand the current stats of all given data.Probably,clustering or centroid of all venues will help us to locate new hotel.
#### this graph represents hotels and how far are they from core location

    -Average distance between hotels is 764 metres
    -Pool at Aida Hotel, and Aida hotel will be more our opponents
## 5 Discussion Section
From above reports,we could get an idea why the predicted one is pointed/clustered on the given spot.First most thing could be the center of attraction for the place.

KMeans have figured out the most common place for all the venues.This output was very adjacent to the core location.This proves the accurate spotting of our predicted algorithm.

Despite of the findings,there were some lack in data.ratings were missing for most of the venues.Also when I compared foursquare data with google map ,i could see there were many hotels and venues found missing in foursquare sadly.
## 6 Conclusion Section
As a business person,one would be able to set up a hotel/restaurant on given spot.This will bring revenue automatically as we have located in very near to core one.We proved this with Kmeans

#### Future Expectation:
As mentioned earlier,most of data needs to be extracted from googlemaps.Even though we got somewhat accurate prediction.To be very confident on concluding our output,we may need more data to analyse.

Research based on hotel reviews and restaurant menus could be used for future purpose.
#### My Experience:
I can say it was not that bad. the first first three courses were kinda easy but that last course specifically the 3rd, 4th and 5th weeks made me super depressed although i had fun trying to slove every problem faced me.thanks for everything you have done
